            South Korea's capital and largest city is Seoul. This place is also one of the most visited city in 
            South Korea by travelers. Seoul has not only modern buildings, but also some traditional buildings, 
            such as hanoks (traditional Korean houses), traditional markets, and Korean castles. So, this place is one of the best place to visit in Korea 
            as they not only show you their latest trend but also their tradition and culture. There are three places that I wanted to 
            share with you which is Gwangjang Night Market, Myeongdong and Insadong.<br><br>
          </p>
          <h2>Gwangjang Market</h2>
          <img src="img/pancake.jpg" alt="owner frying Korean pancake">
          <p>
            One of the earliest and largest traditional markets in South Korea is Gwangjang Market. Gwangjang Market consists 
            of many different types of stores such as fashion, daily need, food etc. Street food is popular in this market.
            They have Spicy Rice Cake, Kimbap, Korean pancake, Dumplings, Donuts and many more. The most popular food is 
            Bindaetteok (Korean Mung Bean pancake), Spicy Rice cake, Korean traditional Donut and Nude Kimbap. The owner are 
            very kind and friendly so I recommend you to visit Gwangjang Market if you are interested with their traditions and 
            food culture.
