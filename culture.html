        <h2>Banchan</h2>
        <p><img src="img/banchan.jpg" alt="Korean side dishes">Banchan is translated as a side dish in English.When you order in a Korean restaurant, it usually goes with the main dish. 
          There are many different kinds of Banchan in Korea, the most common one is called kimchi. Kimchi
          is the most basic side dish in Korea and it is available in every restaurant and household in Korea.
          Even with just Kimchi, it can make up into many type of side dish.<br><br> Kimchi can be made of cabbage,
          radish, cucumber, green onion and etc. My favorite would be Napa Cabbage Kimchi and Cubed Radish Kimchi.
          As the Korean says anything can be made into a kimchi. Kimchi has exotic tastes so not many people can accept it at first. But
          once you get used to it, you would find it heavenly delicious. In detail, Napa Cabbage Kimchi tastes a bit spicy and sour
          while Cubed Radish Kimchi tastes sweeter. Both of them have a chrunchy texture and it gives out a refreshing tastes.<br><br>
          Most of the side dish can be stored in the fridge for a long time and can be consumed when it is cold. Other than Kimchi,
          we have Potato Salad, Japchae (a type of glass noodle), Quail egg that was braised in soy sauce, stir-fried fish cake and many more.
          There is more than 200 million's type of banchan in Korea. Every region in Korea has their own specialty and culture, so they can create
           a different type of side dish when the same ingredient. The way they cook and the seasoning they have used
          would determine the flavor of their own region.

        <h2>Street Food</h2>
        <p><img src="img/streetfood.jpg" alt="Korean street food spicy rice cake and some skewered meat">
          Korean street food is one of the most popular foods in Korea. The price is affordable, and it reminds Korean of their childhood memory. 
          Street Food is easy to eat, and it does not need to wait for a long time after you have ordered. 
          The street food can be found at Korea traditional market, on the street and anywhere. 
          Most of the stalls in Korean traditional markets are run by ajumma (middle-aged women) and halmeoni (grandma).<br><br> 
          There are many different types of street foods in Korea, such as Kimbap (Korean seaweed rice roll), Tteokbokki (spicy rice cake), 
          Bindaetteok (mung bean pancake), fried chicken, and Bungeoppang (fish-shaped bread filled with red bean paste, custard, etc.). 
          The most popular street foods are Tteokbokki (Korean spicy rice cake), Eomuk (Korean fish cake) and Hotteok (Korean honey pancake). <br><br>
          Most Koreans like to eat on-site or take out. The feeling of having hot piping food on the spot is another type of experience that every Korean enjoy. 
          They can see how the food was made in front of them and get to eat it immediately after it was served. 
          They would be serve with paper cup, paper plate or plastic. Plastic is for convenience. If they can't finish the food, 
          they can tie it up and take the leftovers home. If you wanted you try some authentic street food I would recommend you go to the Korean traditional market.

        <h2>Seasonal Food</h2>
        <h3>Summer</h3>
        <p><img src="img/coldnoodle.jpg" alt="Korean Cold noodle">South Korea has a total of four seasons. Summer, Spring, Autumn and Winter. Each season, they would eat their seasonal food that was produce by their 
          country. Seasonal foods are more nutritious and taste better. On Summer, Korea weather is super hot and humid so most of them, 
          would lost their appetite due to the heat. During this time, they would find something to eat that would reduce their body heat and avoid hot food.
          One of the most popular food is Mul Naengmyeon (Korean Cold Noodle Soup), Chimaek (Korean Fried Chicken with Cold Beer) and Bingsu (Korean Shaved Ice).<br><br>
          Mul Naengmyeon contains noodles, meat slices, pear slices, boiled eggs, and a cold soup made from beef or radish kimchi at the end.
          The noodles are cold, you can add some mustard or vinegar according to your taste. The noodle texture 
          is very chewy and the broth tastes a bit sour and super refreshing. It does not have any overpowering flavor just the flavor of 
          the ingredients. Most of the time, they will eat it with some boiled meat or barbecue.<br><br> 
          <img src="img/bingsu.jpg" alt="Korean Shaved Ice" >
          Lastly, the most popular Korea Bingsu in Korea is Patbingsu (Red Bean Shaved Ice), Injeolmi Bingsu 
          (Soy Bean Powder Bingsu) and Fruit Bingsu (made with seasonal fruit). Korean Bingsu is soft and creamy as their ice is made from 
          milk, and they shaved it super finely. It does not have the feeling of eating coarse ice that would hurt our mouth. 
          This is the charm of Korean Bingsu. In Korea, bingsu can are available for delivery too so they does not need 
          to go out on a hot sunny day but just stay at home waiting for delivery. You does not need to worry about it melting 
          as they would put it in a insulated bag and deliver it before it start melting. They are a lot of flavor you can choose other 
          than the three flavor I introduced to you. If you are in Korea made sure you try it out.<br><br>

        <h3>Spring</h3>
        <p>In my opinion, Korea has the most beautiful spring. This is the season where Koreans would spend some time outside with their family and friends.
          South Korea is famous for its cherry blossoms in spring, so many Koreans and travelers plan to have picnics under the cherry trees.   
          They will pack lunch boxes to eat or buy some food from nearby cafes or convenience stores.<br><br> 
          <img src="img/kimbap.jpg" alt="Korean rice wraped in seaweed"> 
          Other than that, food delivery is very convenient in Korea so 
          basically they can deliver to anywhere in Korea most of the time example on a nearby park or nearby a river. Their lunch box would fill with fruits, some basic food 
          and desserts. If it is a family trip, their mother would definitely packed Kimbap for their children and this is a tradition in Korea. 
          In this season, South Korea will also buy some Korean strawberries, because this is their seasonal fruit in spring. Korean Strawberry was known for their sweetness and 
          their size is usually one or two times larger than normal strawberry. A lot of cafe would make strawberry theme food or desserts and there is even a strawberry theme buffet 
          where they serve different kinds of food made from strawberry.</p>

      <div class="culturearticle">
        <h3>Autumn</h3>
        <p>
          Autumn is the season when Koreans celebrate Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving Day). Chuseok is a celebration where 
          all the family members gathers together to prepare food for their ancestor. There will be a memorial service 
          for their ancestors  in their homes or visit the graves of their ancestors.They would prepare food such as 
          rice cake, Korean pancake, some Asian fruits 
          and rice wine.Koreans prepare a variety of pancakes with their families, such as fish cakes, meat cakes, 
          and zucchini pancakes. The most famous of these is the three-color pancake, which is made of mushrooms, 
          crab meat, and ham.<br><br>

          <img src="img/ricecake.jpg" alt="Korean sweet rice cake">
          After their memorial service, they would sit down together and eat the food they have prepared. This event is the time where 
          family able to spend some time together. For dessert, they would have some of the Korean traditional rice cake. 
          Sweet rice cake is made from rice powder. It is normally filled with honey, sweet bean, red bean paste and sesame. 
          They have lots of different colors. The color was made from natural food coloring. Example green color is made from 
          mugwort (a type of edible plant).

        <h3>Winter</h3>
        <p>
          In the winter, Koreans prefer to warm up with soup and spicy snacks. Eomuk soup and spicy Tteokbokki are popular 
          dishes in this season. Street stalls typically sell fish cake in winter.
          Normally, Fish Cake stalls sell it alongside Spicy Rice Cakes. The soup tastes salty and savoury because the Fish Cake 
          soup was boiled for a long time with the fish cake. <br><br> 
          <img src="img/noodlesoup.jpg" alt="Korean Noodle Soup with some side dishes">
          In addition, we also have steamed buns, Kalguksu (Korean knife cut noodles) and Bungeoppang (Korean fish-shaped bread).
          It has to eat Steam Bun during Winter time. This item was sold at any convenient store in Korea.
          The Steam Bun has different flavors such as the red bean paste, meat and pizza. They also like to eat anything that has soup
          such as Kalguksu. Kalguksu is a traditional noodle soup. The broth is made with dried anchovy, and you eat with Kimchi as
          it taste a bit plain, but it is a bowl of comfort food that every Korean love.
          This is the top food list Korean eat during Winter time.
