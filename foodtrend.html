        <p>
          In the year 2021, everyone in the whole world could not travel due to covid-19. Koreans like to travel as they can  
          learn and experience the culture of another country. So in the year 2021, Korean food industry economy has decreased due 
          to lack of customers and to revive their business, they try to create some new recipes.These recipes have become the food 
          trend in Korea as everyone tries to follow or remake the recipes. Some of the recipes are inspired by Korean Youtuber. 
          The most popular food trend is Rose Tteokbokki (Rose sauce rice cake), Croffle, and Bombolone.<br><br>

          <img src="img/rose.jpg" alt="korean rose tteokbokki">
          Rose Tteokbokki is a new flavor of Korean Spicy rice cake. Korean Rose Tteokbokki is made by adding heavy cream and 
          sliced cheese into the normal spicy rice cake. Cream can reduce the spiciness of Korean Tteokbokki. It tastes like 
          a creamy carbonara dish but with a hint of spiciness that comes from the Gochujang (Korean red chili paste). The hint 
          of spice will cut the feeling of greasiness after a bowl of carbonara. As Koreans love spicy food, this idea is the perfect 
          recipe for them. Many of the Korean Tteokbokki franchise add these recipes into their menu with a little twist of their 
          own idea. The most popular Rose Tteobokki in Korea would be Baedduk Tteokbokki, Sinjeon Tteokbokki and Yupdduk Tteokbokki.<br><br>

          <img src="img/croffle.jpg" alt="Croffle with ice cream on top">
          Croffle is also one of the hottest food trend in Korea now. Croffle is made by pressing the crossaint pastry into the waffle machine. 
          This is super easy to make. All you need is a waffle maker and some pre-made croissants and pastries available in supermarkets near you. 
          After the croffle was cooked, you can add on some honey, cinammon powder or even ice cream.
          It tastes buttery and crispy. It is suitable to make at home and it only needs about 10 minutes to make it. Simple and delicious. 
          Korean also has a trend where they would just put anything into the waffle maker. For example, bread, rice cakes and even pizza.<br><br>

          <img src="img/bombolone.jpg" alt="donut filled with jam">
          Other than that, Bombolone is another famous food trend in Korea right now. Bombolone is a doughnut filled with jam or custard.
          This food trend was started by a cafe named Knotted. They sell donuts, cakes, and croffles. Their most famous menu would be 
          their donuts. They provided many different flavors of donuts such as milk cream, earl grey, nutella,choco pudding, butter kaya, rashberry and etc. 
          Their top sales flavors is Milk cream, Earl grey and Choco pudding. The donut is filled with a generous amount of filling that is rich and nor greasy 
          plus the texture of the donut is soft and spongy.<br><br>

          So, other cafes started to follow this trend and make their own bombolone flavors. Various flavors of food are available in Korea such as Shooting star 
          (inspire by Baskin Robbins Shooting Star), Butter Kaya, Butter with Red Bean and etc. 
          This has become a food trend in Korea, because many famous Youtubers have commented on this doughnut on their channel, and their comments are positive.
          In the end, this have become one of the top food that needs to be eat in 2021.

      <div class="foodtrendarticle">
        <p>
          The 2020 food trends in Korea are mainly influenced by Korean Youtubers and Korean artists. Owing to Covid-19, the government 
          decided to have a lockdown to prevent the rise of pandemic cases in the country. Lockdown has made the citizen 
          stay at home excepting going out to buy necessity products. As they could not go out, they have plenty of time at home so 
          Koreans created a few trend online. For, example making Dalgona coffee and Souffle pancake with minimum ingredients.<br><br>

          <img src="img/dalgona.jpg" alt="Dalgona coffee latte">
          Dalgona coffee was made by using sugar, coffee powder and water. The ratio of ingredients is 1-1-1. You only have to whip
          the mixture until the color turn pale and the cream has become fluffy. After that you add it into a cup of milk. Voila,
          the coffee is done. It tastes like a latte served in a cafe. Smooth and creamy.
          Next is Souffle pancake. This recipe also has the same concept as Dalgona Coffee that is you need
          to whip the egg white until it turns into a meringue.<br><br>

          <img src="img/macaron.jpg" alt="Korean fat macaron">
          In addition, there are two super popular foods in Korea in 2020. One is Korean Fat Macaron and another 
          one is Korean Cheese Hot Dog. Korean fat macarons are different from ordinary French macarons. Korean Macaron is 
          larger than French Macaron. They used the same cookies but the filling is twice or triple the amount of normal macaron.
          They also add fruit, biscuits or jam to the macarons. The most famous store in Korea I know is Scoop Dang Macaron. 
          Their macaron is delicious and it is not too sweet.<br><br>

          <img src="img/hotdog.jpg" alt="Korean hot dog">
          What's more, Korean Mozzarella Cheese Hot Dog is another super famous food in Korea. It is famous for it's cheese 
          pull. Korean Hot Dog is made from hot dogs, mozzarella cheese or fish cake and wrapped it up in the batter. You 
          can also add extra ingredients to the hot dog, such as potato or sweet potato wedges. After it was fried, most Koreans likes to 
          put sugar, ketchup, mustard or chili sauce onto it. When you have the first bite, the cheese would stretch out of 
          the hot dog and this is called cheese pull. It is fun to eat and you can also take some insta worthy photo with it. 
          The outer layer of the hotdog tastes like fried donut and the cheese tastes super delicious. For cheese lovers, this is definitely a must-try.
